# Real-Time-Drowsiness-Detection-using-MobileNetV2
A real-time drowsiness detection system using MobileNetV2 and PyTorch. Classifies eye states (open vs. closed) from live webcam feed using Haar cascade and triggers an audio alert when drowsiness is detected. Achieves 90%+ accuracy with efficient preprocessing, transfer learning, and real-time inference.
